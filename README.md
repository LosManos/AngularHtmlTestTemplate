# AngularHtmlTestTemplate
Showcasing a html test template

See [here](MyApp/src/app/project/project.component.spec.ts) for a simple test, testing HTML output.

There is a proxy variant in [another file](MyApp/src/app/project/project.component.html.spec.ts).  
It does not render is child component for good an vad.

There is more information, and different from my solution at Angular [itself](https://angular.io/guide/testing-components-scenarios).
